<p>
This project is still a work in progress at this time. We hope to fully implement uploading images and storing them in the database for user's to view and send as an expense sheet to thier respective clients or accounting teams.
</p>

<p>
To send this information to their recipients the user would select each individual expense on their dashboard they wish to send as a report, then generate a report of those expenses. These items are then automatically marked as pending and filed in the table below unpaid until the user marks them as paid.
</p>

<p>
The final project would also allow our users to share a randomly generated URL to their specific expense report so that the recipient can just view the report online and print it on a home device.
